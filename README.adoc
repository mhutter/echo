= echo

Service that echoes various attributes of the HTTP request.

== Usage

`/ip`:: Returns the RemoteAddr of the request
`/headers`:: Returns all Headers in plain text

== Developing

I recommend using https://github.com/codegangsta/gin[gin] for livereload during development:

    gin --build cmd/server

To make sure everything builds as expected, use `make server` to build the
binary locally and `make image` to build the docker image.
